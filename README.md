# Time-series in Hyper-parameter Initialization of Machine Learning Techniques

This repository has the codes to run and analyze results of our paper: 'Time-series in Hyper-parameter Initialization of Machine Learning Techniques' submited and published in the 22nd International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning (IDEAL).

In this repository, we have two sub-folders:
* hp_experiments: lists all the code used to run hyperparameter tuning experiments; and 
* analysis: the code used to generate our automated plots
